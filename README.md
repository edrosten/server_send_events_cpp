Server Send Evends
==================

Here's a complete by-hand implementation of server send events in C++ so nothing
is hidden behind layers of framework.

Compile by typing "make" You might need to change the compiler to something 
other than g++-7 (probably just g++ on a recent enough system).

Run the server (./server)

Then load up page.html in your browser.

Then press enter in the terminal in which you ran the server to send an event
